Server stuff in /srv

when transferring to SSL, needed to debug from the minified version by:
beautifying index.js of the dist build
finding out that connecting to sockets was the issue
check documentation to find out if the SSL needs to be set somehow
used createSocket(true) to do it!
Rebuild, upload
