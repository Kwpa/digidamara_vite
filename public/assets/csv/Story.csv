"s_001","t_001","1","Aids and Mentors","Creatures and peoples from many galaxies come to visit the Wipio in Cush Cush galaxy as they are known to use their spiritual prowess to help others solve problems. ","0","t_001"
"s_002","t_001","2","Healing","If one is lost in their lives, they will find cushion here, returning to their own galaxy with the freshest air. The Wipio are friends and mentors to all and share their practice mind to mind. ","1","t_001"
"s_003","t_001","3","How they got here
","Master Gauri and Master Refilwe were sent to represent Cush Cush at Digidamara because they are well respected and full of knowledge.","1","t_001"
"s_004","t_001","4","Their Motivation
","They want to bring their practice of forgiveness and acceptance into the next universe. But it was not always so.","1","t_001"
"s_005","t_001","5","The Test
","In order to master the technique of soul travel, one must descend into the depths of soul.","1","t_001"
"s_006","t_001","6","Partners","Gauri met Refilwe there, lost in the chasm of void. It took the strength of a whole community of Masters, channeled through Gauri, to ascend back to themselves in this plain of existence.","0","t_001"
"s_007","t_001","7","Doubt","Since the collapse of the universe, Master Refilwe has been haunted by the call of the Great Redistribution.","2","t_001"
"s_008","t_001","8","Reaching","Master Gauri says they can be the strength for both of them.","2","t_001"
"s_009","t_001","9","Unnamed","But what transformation will wait for them beyond the void?","2","t_001"
"s_010","t_001","10","Admiration","The Promoter admires these two because they keep faith at all costs.  It is a shame it will all be for naught.","2","t_001"
"s_011","t_002","1","Galactic Friends","Apex and Bobbleon are very close to each other as galaxies, both in temperament and in distance.","0","t_002"
"s_012","t_002","2","Handy Travel!","In fact, The Brutus travel to Bobbleon by grouping their bodies hand in hand in a giant line!","3","t_002"
"s_013","t_002","3","Ideals","The Brutus are known for their team building skills, discipline and efficiency - respect in competition is key for them.","3","t_002"
"s_014","t_002","4","Foundation","When one visits a Brutus village, they can expect a riot of bright colours, athletic obstacle courses and spongey geometry. Pleasure is found in purity and economy of movement.","3","t_002"
"s_015","t_002","5","Why them?","Formation 16 and Formation 17 left their team behind to represent Apex at Digidamara. Chosen for their strength and vibrancy, they have one wish - to save their leader and their way of life.","3","t_002"
"s_016","t_002","6","Why they are here","A few months ago, their valiant leader fell ill. Every day they weaken a little more.  While the death of the chief is coming slowly, Formation 16 and Formation 17 hope to win Digidamara and bring their whole society through the Great Redistribution intact. ","0","t_002"
"s_017","t_002","7","The Pressure","This was not an easy decision to make. Formation 16 knew a healer from the planet Lye in Apex who could help their leader. They used to be the best of friends.","4","t_002"
"s_018","t_002","8","The Betrayal","As the Collapse began to suck galactic locations into the void, the Lye abandoned Brutus, thinking they would disappear first. Formation 17 convinced Formation 16 that it wasn't safe to continue their friendship with a betrayer.","4","t_002"
"s_019","t_002","9","Revenge?","Formation 17 worries that if they win Digidamara, the Brutus will in turn abandon the Lye during the Great Redistribution, casting them into the void permanently, never to return.","4","t_002"
"s_020","t_002","10","Multiversal Will","The Promoter honours the tenacity and strength of this team. Perseverance no matter what will get you where you need to go, and the Promoter will never give up, never give up, never give up.","4","t_002"
"s_021","t_003","1","The Light is Gone","The Unknown Galaxy is called just that because no one knows exactly how it came to be the way it is. Noxious gas fills every planetary nook and cranny while plums of dangerous toxic space wind drifts in the dark solar depths.","0","t_003"
"s_022","t_003","2","Into the Weird","Strange holes have appeared in spacetime along The Unknown's borders and occasionally a piece of debris escapes galactic orbit to drift into nearby systems, causing further speculation.","5","t_003"
"s_023","t_003","3","A Tipping Point","Some 50 solar years ago, it was heard that the Quxerre society was developing something revolutionary, but shortly after all communication ceased.","5","t_003"
"s_024","t_003","4","Vanished","It is widely acknowledged that this new invention caused a disaster that wiped out all galactic life but no trace of the deadly source could be found and the reason behind the invention's creation has been lost.","5","t_003"
"s_025","t_003","5","Wanderers","Twill and Kitt, from what they can tell us, wandered the wastes of their home galaxy in search of help and survivors to no avail.  Resourceful inventors themselves, they created helo bubbles to protect themselves from the harsh environments.","5","t_003"
"s_026","t_003","6","Forsaken","and wing sails to navigate the torn areas of spacetime. After the explosion, they are always aware or anxious about inventing even though this is their strength. Imagine being so afraid of the thing you love to do?","0","t_003"
"s_027","t_003","7","Moving On","One day Twill convinced Kitt that they should take their chances and go to other galaxies, to make new relationships and find new friends. There was no one left to leave behind.","6","t_003"
"s_028","t_003","8","A Curious Hand","They were picked up by the Space Station to represent one of the last galaxies, and because the Space Station knows what it is to be alone in the universe.","6","t_003"
"s_029","t_003","9","Renewal","Winning Digidamara is their chance to start over completely.","6","t_003"
"s_030","t_003","10","Painful Memories","The Promoter has a healthy respect for these two and once shared similar dreams. But that dream was shattered by infidelity.","6","t_003"
"s_031","t_004","1","Canyon Swings and Meadows Green","Gorgplain is a rough, mineral rich and expansive place, with many planets composed of rocky chasms and vast liliagreen fields.","","t_004"
"s_032","t_004","2","Heritage","The Sglunkus Snorfluxii have a widespread culture and now occupy most solar sectors to some extent, continuing a long and complex tradition that values courage above all.","","t_004"
"s_033","t_004","3","Teach Me How to Fly","Hyper speed has evolved in most beings in this galaxy; they don't need space ships to travel in space they simply fly.  Gorglium, the main nourishing element, is also a power source for other galaxies.","","t_004"
"s_034","t_004","4","A Turn","Bobbleon is a close galaxy and when Gorglium and liliagreen grass started to become rarer at the turn of the Collapse, more Sglunkus Snorfluxii started venturing to Bobbleon.","","t_004"
"s_035","t_004","5","Testing the Neighbors","They love the colour and the flavours of that galaxy, but their massive size and appetites are ruining fragile Eeksum cities, causing mounting tension.","","t_004"
"s_036","t_004","6","Gossip","Grunter is known for his pacifist stance in the matter, currently resisting the consumption of Eeksums. Yet this peaceful goal could not keep scandal from shrouding his arrival to Digidamara.","","t_004"
"s_037","t_004","7","The Runner Up","Grunter was the second choice. The elders wanted his brother, Prundiar, to compete. Prundiar represents everything a Snorfluxxi should be.","","t_004"
"s_038","t_004","8","The Renegade","Grunter traveled the universe dancing with the intergalactic Soul Train but some felt he was too subversive and not the best representative of the Snorfuxii traditions that need to be taken forward into the next universe. ","","t_004"
"s_039","t_004","9","All Consuming","In a fit of rage, Grunter ate his brother in a fight and took his place. His family is now divided with some disowning him and others rooting for him because a Snorfluxii winning is better than none. ","","t_004"
"s_40","t_004","10","Give Me More","Grunter believes that strength isn't always everything, and he wants to shake things up in the Great Redistribution. The Promoter is only too willing to take advantage of Grunter's pluck.","","t_004"
"s_041","t_005","1","Wonderland","Bobbleon is a lush paradise that is frequented by many life forms year round and you can find Eeksums on almost every planet in the system! ","","t_005"
"s_042","t_005","2","One love","Prolific reproducers, Eeksums have multi annual â€˜bloom' events where they all get together in warm ponds and have beautiful orgies which create the next generation.","","t_005"
"s_043","t_005","3","Happy Together","Their cities are wonderous grottos of light, life, colour and music that attract visitors from across the intergalactic pantheon. In particular, Eeksums and other communal life forms of Bobbleon like Apex art, as it champions the many in the one.","","t_005"
"s_044","t_005","4","Never Alone","Eeksums are the entertainers, performers and athletes of the intergalactic circuit, are the life of the party and always work in pairs, trios or more! For Babe and Bas, winning Digidamara is about being the BEST.","","t_005"
"s_045","t_005","5","Who Wants to Live Forever?","They crave fame and the spotlight like no other and will bring Eeksum glory fully to bear in the Great Redistribution.","","t_005"
"s_046","t_005","6","Money Matters","Some are overly critical of their dubious and secret sponsorships given the topsy turvy nature of financial value in Bobbleon - one day metazips are the top currency, the next it's bezocola?!","","t_005"
"s_047","t_005","7","The Darkside","Despite this, none can fault their rightful arrival at Digidamara. There was an official entry contest on Bobbleon (Eeksums LOVE a contest as much as the love a boogie!) and they won to much acclaim. But the price of fame is steep.","","t_005"
"s_048","t_005","8","Daredevils","Bas has suffered from many stress related conditions and Babe's response has been to push their risktaking to the limit.","","t_005"
"s_049","t_005","9","Loss","They come from many siblings, but knowing they will never make many again, never be part of a great bloom again, is difficult.","","t_005"
"s_050","t_005","10","Reflector","Burning bright until the end keeps the darkness at bay. The Promoter is threatened by these two - they are an inconvenient mirror of their desires.","","t_005"
"s_051","t_006","1","In the Beginning","It is said some Mandulae have not felt the warmth of light on their aquatic bodies since the dawn of the last universe.","","t_006"
"s_052","t_006","2","Elusive Guests","Although they drift eternally through Deep Innks, they have been spotted occasionally in other galaxies, articularly at beautiful locations or events, where they have hardly interacted with others at all.","","t_006"
"s_053","t_006","3","Fear of the Uknown","This led to political speculation that they have sinister intentions, although others have treated their rare presence as a blessing.","","t_006"
"s_054","t_006","4","Entranced","They move so beautifully it brings many witnesses to tears instantly. When spotted, others have noticed that their movements are much like a slowed but graceful ballroom dance.","","t_006"
"s_055","t_006","5","The Uninvited","At Digidamara, Enthar and Auram were not invited, but simply appeared, which caused a massive shock.","","t_006"
"s_056","t_006","6","Fluency in Another Sense","When asked what their goals were for the next universe, Enthar and Auram silently began stirring slowly in a lovely partner dance. Fluidity is key.","","t_006"
"s_057","t_006","7","Allure","In fact we know more about the Deep Innks than we do this couple, and that is not much. Due to its extreme inaccessibility Deep Innks is a fantasy destination for the universe's uber-rich and wanna-be-tourists alike,","","t_006"
"s_058","t_006","8","The Value of a Mystery","though few have been successful at visiting. Images that have been taken from under the surface have sold for great deals of currency and have been widely published in universe-wide publications.","","t_006"
"s_059","t_006","9","Impenetrable ","Recon devices within the viscous waters of this galaxy are found to be extruded after mere hours.","","t_006"
"s_060","t_006","10","Hold Me Close","The Promoter is wary of this team. Enther and Auram's dance brings up coursing waves of sadness through their being - memories of a universe long past flash before their eyes. The sadness turns to rage.","","t_006"
