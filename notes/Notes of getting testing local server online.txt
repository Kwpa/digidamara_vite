There are services out there that can expose a port to the internet:
https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/
https://ngrok.com/
http://localhost.run/

For now, localtunnel seems to be working with vite production build on port 5000

While running the server locally (must use yarn build and yarn serve) you can then use the following command: 
npx localtunnel --port 5000  

This will give you a randomly named proxy server url such as: https://rude-jellyfish-27.loca.lt/

This can be shared with testers! :)

So instructions to get things up and running!

1) Run docker desktop > start containers (may need docker-compose file to be initiated using docker-compose up cmd)
2) Open Powershell at the master folder (i.e. nakama server), enter:
cd ServerPrototype\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1
.\ServerPrototype.exe reset
.\ServerPrototype.exe init
.\ServerPrototype.exe run
3) Expose port 

Problem! Mixed content prevents a https site loading http stuff - resolved by entering correct info into authentication this.client.Device
