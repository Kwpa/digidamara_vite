christian s.
2:44 PM
i have used all my action points...minus 1
and also used all my 'votes'
Kalervo Sinervo
2:45 PM
me too
christian s.
2:48 PM
my screen is an OnlyFans concept.
Scott DeJong
2:49 PM
Does Asynchronous mean I can close my browser and reopen it later?
Kalervo Sinervo
2:49 PM
Is the chat functional right now?
Scott DeJong
2:50 PM
if people login now, do they join the game as it stands?
Kalervo Sinervo
2:52 PM
Mine says round 2, but 0 points
Stays the same after reloading too
Lynn H
2:54 PM
drugs obviously
christian s.
2:54 PM
Chrome on android phone is still showing 'Round 2, Action Points 1" after refresh.
Scott DeJong
2:55 PM
After the refresh the action bar of the pillows sat overtop the vote window. Opening and closing it fixed that though.
christian s.
2:57 PM
i have used all my action points and voted forRound 2.
Samsung Galaxy A21 - (android)
Kalervo Sinervo
2:58 PM
I am using a chrome incognito window on an iphone x
I am also done for this round
Shayle
2:58 PM
done!
Lynn H
2:59 PM
cat wants to check whether spring is hrre. Back in 1.
Lynn H
3:05 PM
no!!!!!!!!
christian s.
3:05 PM
i feel....ok?
Kalervo Sinervo
3:08 PM
Don't care about pillows, maybe because they were the opening screen, making me feel more like they're a default?
christian s.
3:09 PM
Incognito chrome (samsung galaxy a21) tab reloaded well with 'round 5,  points 5'.....
However my Firefox tab (macos high sierra 10.13) reloaded with Round 5, 0 Points....
Kalervo Sinervo
3:09 PM
I didn't get any new action points for round 5
Shayle
3:16 PM
maybe you could type the questions but keep the convo live because wifi is a bit laggy
You
3:16 PM
What is exciting or memorable about the experience?
Kalervo Sinervo
3:18 PM
Who were everyone's favourite teams? I liked The Brutus
I second Lynn's comments about the votes - very much enjoyed them
Kalervo Sinervo
3:19 PM
Or maybe if the votes weren't an on/off binary, e.g. bribe or don't bribe?
Kalervo Sinervo
3:20 PM
I also enjoyed the pixel art, but thought it wanted colour
Lynn H
3:22 PM
Liked the visual aesthetic too. But really wanted sound. Great oppottunity for dance and etherial sci-fi y sounds.
Shayle
3:23 PM
feel like im missing a voice for the promoter. some sort of sound to signal when the comments are coming in
Lynn H
3:23 PM
Sound when the box opens!
Shayle
3:25 PM
i wonder if we can get the team's reactions to being kicked out
You
3:25 PM
What are your first impressions of characters?
Does something standout?
Scott DeJong
3:27 PM
A name indicates style!
I also didn't vote for the brutus because of their name and story in relation.
Scott DeJong
3:28 PM
I agree with Lyne. With asynchronous that makes a difference.
christian s.
3:28 PM
i definetely had a 'player bias' re: names...and 'shapes' of the Teams. Reminds me of why we chose certain Mario Kart players over others...
Kalervo Sinervo
3:31 PM
It sounds like the video content is going to drive the game in a bunch of ways
Lynn H
3:32 PM
Like reminders .
christian s.
3:34 PM
agree.
Scott DeJong
3:34 PM
I would agree
Kalervo Sinervo
3:34 PM
I also agree
You
3:35 PM
What was your experience of the donating and voting?
Scott DeJong
3:38 PM
I also think that might change if upgrading was a thing? I would be more conscious of how I spent them (energy vs upgrade)
christian s.
3:41 PM
...like Elections, literally.
"strategic voting'
Kalervo Sinervo
3:42 PM
PLEASE do no make this game feel more like elections
christian s.
3:42 PM
(sorry, i hear you)
Kalervo Sinervo
3:42 PM
Lol
Like Dancing with the Stars?
Or Baby Ballroom?
Kalervo Sinervo
3:43 PM
It's on Netflix iirc: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8159960/
Kalervo Sinervo
3:45 PM
I like Scott'
s solution here
christian s.
3:46 PM
i like 'transparency'....maybe during one specifi round its 'secret' ?
Scott DeJong
3:47 PM
Or ambigious in the visual (like one is a big larger/bigger than the other, but no numbers)
I think my voting comment was more for round end. I apologize for the lack of clarity
Shayle
3:49 PM
will the video puppet performances shift depending on how the teams are doing? whether they have a lot of energy or not, etc.?
christian s.
3:50 PM
Its fun to be thrown-off as a player and be forced to restrategize btw rational/emotional....
Kalervo Sinervo
3:52 PM
Co-sign everything Scott just said re interface
Scott DeJong
3:52 PM
Or be able to pop it out in an alternate window
Lynn H
3:53 PM
I like what the chat looks like.
Scott DeJong
3:54 PM
Flagging that I have a meeting at 3, and will probably head out 2 min prior to grab water before it.
Kalervo Sinervo
3:55 PM
No water for you Scott
YOU GO THIRSTY
Kalervo Sinervo
3:56 PM
Seeing all of these makes me think I'm much more likely to vote based on actual dance performance?
Scott DeJong
3:57 PM
If you sent them out I will happily write some thoughts down
christian s.
3:57 PM
bye Scott!  
Scott DeJong
3:57 PM
Bye :D
Kalervo Sinervo
3:57 PM
Like I won't give any shits about the characters or the stories if I get to see different interesting things happen with this set of puppets or that each day
christian s.
3:58 PM
my loyalty would change definetely based on performance and coolness/texture of them.
Lynn H
3:58 PM
I want to talk about tensions between here and now (dancing/voting) and the future(s)
christian s.
3:59 PM
Almost touching on the ASMR-quality of each team/puppet.
Kalervo Sinervo
4:02 PM
Big co-sign on attaching excitement to the everyday nature of the objects. I love puppets that look like I could make them myself out of household items
(if I had any crafting skill that is)
Shayle
4:06 PM
maybe the winner is not so much about futures but really is a representation of what people are attracted to in the now
christian s.
4:07 PM
folks, i must leave now. It was a pleasure to playtest with you all.
Lynn H
4:10 PM
at the moment the larger stakes don't do much? I don't mean that it would be better as a serious game.
